# Mirror to download GraphicsMagick releases

https://graphicsmagick-project.github.io/GraphicsMagick-releases/


## Special Issues:

- The FTP site ftp.graphicsmagick.org is now shut down due to a lack of bandwith,
  extremely abusive users (including from Google and customers of Amazon Web Services),
  and a lack of support from the user community. Another factor is that FTP support
  has been removed from popular web browsers. This is very unfortunate since the
  site served multiple usages, including providing a lot of historical data (e.g. related
  to PNG) which may not be available elsewhere.

- GraphicsMagick really does need some additional productive volunteers.
  For several years now, the burden has entirely been on me (Bob Friesenhahn).
  I have been sheparding the project for 20 years already (and contributed to
  ImageMagick and GraphicsMagick combined for 26 years already).
  It is not reasonable to expect someone with a full time job (and expecting to
  retire in a few years) to do all of the work.
